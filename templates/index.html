      <h2>Characteristics of a register</h2>
      <p>A register consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a single dataset conforming to a defined standard</li>
        <li>a standard API for reading data</li>
        <li>a standard API for adding to a register</li>
        <li>automated tests for verifying the register-specific rules for data integrity</li>
        <li>a digital certificate to sign changes to a register</li>
        <li>a tamper-proof audit trail of changes made to a register</li>

      <h2>Aims of the register project</h2>
      <p>Over the course of an alpha and beta the aim is to demonstrate by way of working software, the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a standard for datatypes and field names for register entries</li>
        <li>a software appliance that exhibits the charateristics of a register</li>
        <li>a set of tools for independently verfiying the integrity of a register and the data held within it</li>
      </ul>
